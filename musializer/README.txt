Hello! This is the first ever Alpha Release of Musializer on Windows!

- Double-click musializer.exe. It's not signed or anything cause I
  don't know how to do that. So Windows may freak out about that a
  bit. You just have to believe me that I didn't put in viruses in
  here. At least intentionally...

- Drag&Drop some music onto the window. Not all formats are supported,
  so some files could be rejected.

- Press Space to Pause/Unpause.

- Press F to render the video. It creates output.mp4 in the same
  folder as musializer.exe. Keep in mind that it can take some time.

- If you need to check the logs use musializer-logged.bat instead of
  musializer.exe. It generated log.txt file which contains the logs.

- Don't expect too much from this application! It's not even Beta yet!

- The full source code is available at https://github.com/tsoding/musializer

- Have fun!
